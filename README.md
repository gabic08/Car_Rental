Project for faculty: a windows application made with Java Swing that helps you rent a car

To begin with, I would like to say that I did not have enough time or knowledge when I did the project to be able to use files or databases so I used strings to store the data. The program is made in Java Swing. <br>Each window was created by writing code.
