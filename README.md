# Car_Rental
Project for faculty: a windows application made with Java Swing that simulates renting a car

To begin with, I would like to say that I did not have enough time or knowledge when I did the project to be able to use files or databases so I used strings to store the data. The program is made in Java Swing. <br>Each window was created by writing code. <br>In the future I plan to redo this project with modern methods and using databases.
<br><br>When the application starts, a window appears in which the username and password must be entered.<br><br>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102962523/165785824-be962881-87d0-4307-94b5-511caa556ec5.png)<br><br><br>
If the user cannot authenticate, the password and username can be changed using a backup password.<br><br>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102962523/165785962-e16510c1-0847-450d-bd64-bce7adb78316.png)<br><br><br>
After logging in, a frame opens.<br><br>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102962523/165786236-60c553be-3270-4cdf-81ec-de57333ca21d.png)<br><br><br>
The frame contains a menu bar at the top and two panels, which contain several smaller panels.
In the first panel there are labels describing the type of cars available for rent, and buttons containing the names of those cars.
The second panel also consists of two smaller panels, one up, one down: after pressing a button in the first panel, in the second panel in the top panel will appear the details of the selected car, and in the bottom panel, the methods to rent the car.<br><br>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102962523/165786401-f0af49e8-dc61-4a73-a183-8234a93b3779.png)<br><br><br>
If you do not complete everything necessary, the car cannot be rented.<br><br>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102962523/165786807-31894233-a00a-48ff-a8c5-45ee92b2d72c.png)<br><br><br>
If all the fields are filled in, the car can be rented; also, to be able to decide what color you would like the car to have when you rent it, you can see images with the car in different colors:<br><br>

<br><br>Rented cars appear in a section of the menu bar. These are stored in a string, so they reset when the program is closed. In the future I will use a database to store this data.<br><br>
